Render this file to a HTML file.\nYou will push the .qmd file and rendered HTML file to a private GitHub repostory on GitHub classroom. The link to create a private GitHub repository for yourself to complete Project 1 will be posted in CoursePlus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis creates an empty repository. You will need to clone the reopository locally, add your code, and push your code from your local repo to the remote repository on GitHub Classroom when ready.\nPlease show all the code, if relevant to a section.\n\n\nThe TAs will grade the contents in the GitHub repo by cloning the repo and checking for all the things described below."
